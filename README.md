# Seniority Dynamics

**[→ Live demo](https://d-j-king.github.io/seniority-dynamics/)**

An interactive simulation of workplace rank dynamics, grounded in economic theory. Even when younger people are more capable, organizations tend to re-sort back into age order — this simulation lets you see exactly why, and find the conditions where merit can compete.

## What you're looking at

Each dot is an employee. Their horizontal position (tenure) is fixed. Their vertical position (rank) evolves every frame under three competing forces:

| Force | Slider | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **α · merit** | α | Pulls rank toward competence level |
| **β · seniority** | β | Spring pulling rank back to what tenure predicts |
| **γ · holdup** | γ | Pushes juniors down when they've displaced seniors |

The key ratio is **α/β**. Below ~0.5 → seniority wins. Above ~2 → meritocracy. Most real organizations sit around 0.1–0.3.

## The 5 scenarios

Each scenario pre-loads the simulation and fires a mutiny after 1 second.

| # | Scenario | What to watch |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **[Seniority dominates](https://d-j-king.github.io/seniority-dynamics/sim.html?alpha=0.3&beta=1.5&gamma=0.5&sigma=0.06&speed=0.7&label=Seniority+dominates&mutiny=1)** | Blue τ(rank, tenure) crashes on mutiny, then fully recovers |
| 2 | **[Meritocracy](https://d-j-king.github.io/seniority-dynamics/sim.html?alpha=1.8&beta=0.3&gamma=0.05&sigma=0.06&speed=0.7&label=Meritocracy)** | Dots self-sort by color; competent people rise regardless of tenure |
| 3 | **[Holdup fortress](https://d-j-king.github.io/seniority-dynamics/sim.html?alpha=0.2&beta=0.2&gamma=2.0&sigma=0.04&speed=0.5&label=Holdup+fortress&mutiny=1)** | Slower, lumpier recovery — driven by institutional-knowledge leverage, not norms |
| 4 | **[Phase boundary](https://d-j-king.github.io/seniority-dynamics/sim.html?alpha=1.0&beta=1.0&gamma=0.2&sigma=0.06&speed=0.7&label=Phase+boundary&mutiny=1)** | Neither attractor wins cleanly; both τ values hover around 0.5 |
| 5 | **[Replicator dynamics](https://d-j-king.github.io/seniority-dynamics/sim.html?alpha=0.3&beta=0.8&gamma=1.5&sigma=0.04&speed=0.6&scene=2&label=Replicator+dynamics&mutiny=1)** | Gold rings show seniors hoarding knowledge in real time; rings bloom on threat, fade on calm |
